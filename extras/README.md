Git has already been initialized. JupyterLab's home directory is mirroring root project directory from the local OS. git

Create notebooks in the notebooks directory. In this directory there are some example notebooks to familiarize with good ways to get started using pyspark in a jupyter environment.

A good place to start is going to `notebooks/GETTING STARTED`

TO DO:

Must go install jupyterlab/toc. Choose the extensions icon from the left sidebar in JupyterLab. Enable 3rd party extensions and install jupyterlab/toc. After installing you'll need to do a rebuild jupyterlab, a message will inform you. 


Select Settings in the top menu bar and go to "Advanced Settings" and choose Table of Contents. Set this attribute in to override the default non collapsible behavior of the table of contents extension. 
`{"collapsibleNotebooks": true}`
